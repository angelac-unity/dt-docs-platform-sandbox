# Get started
<!-- The basic steps to get a scene working with the package. At the end of these steps, the user should be able to see information from the package in a Unity Editor scene. -->

Integrating live systems with this package typically involves the following activities:
​
1. Identify the services/systems that you want to integrate in your enterprise.
2. Write and configure Data Connectors for your services and systems.
3. Define a specialized ontology for the domain of the systems and specify the relationships between  entities that come from the different systems that the Data Connectors bring in (if needed).
4. Define notification rules based on the integrated data and devices.
5. Create a Unity-based client application, either from scratch or using the Reference Application.
6. Define the 3D model(s) of the facility and bring it(them) into the application (through Reflect, in-editor importing, or some other means)
7. Associate the 3D models to the data the Data Connectors bring in. You can do this manually or through the Data Association Framework <!--(when available)-->.
8. Create a custom user interface in your client application that addresses  target use cases, either by with the SDK package directly or through the UI package.

# Recommended structure

This section explains how to open a project that will use your feature and start doing cool things with it.

At the end of this section, a user should know where everything they need to be successful with your feature is located, and be ready to follow any instructions on accomplishing use cases.

## Verifying project settings

Are there any project or editor settings that the user needs to modify or verify before they can do cool stuff? Describe them, and then offer specific instructions!

## Identifying new content

Tell me things like:

* What new things can they see that they haven’t seen before?
* What kinds of GameObjects or assets should they pay attention to?
* Are there special scripts that they need to add?

## Do any other settings, configurations, license issues, JSON files, accounts, or integrations need attention before we get to work?
