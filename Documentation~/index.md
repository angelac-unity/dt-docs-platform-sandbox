# My Digital Twin Platform Service

Introduce your service using its formal, marketing-approved name and explain what it is intended to help users be successful with.

Ask UX for a nice image to represent your service and put it here.

After reading your introduction, a user should know whether or not your sample project is relevant or interesting to them.

Helpful questions you use for writing prompts include:
* Why would someone want to use it instead of another tool?
* Who is it designed to be interesting to?

Example of an introductory blurb:

 >*Use the Unity Recorder package to capture and save in-game data. For example, use Unity Recorder to record an mp4 file during a game session. The Unity Recorder package also includes an interface for setting-up and triggering recording sessions.*
